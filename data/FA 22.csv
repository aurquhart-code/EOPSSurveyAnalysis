 What I am upset of is I received an email message from EOPS saying this will be my last semester.  I have continued and completed doing all my required work as a EOPS continuous student and  I will also continue to take courses at SWC on Spring 2023 semester. Therefore, I don't understand why I am being pushed off the program when I will continue being a student at SWC, completing all my studies in order to get my Associates Degree. That is why I cannot comprehend why I  am suddenly being left out of the program. 
My counselor can even address with the courses I need for the upcoming semester
