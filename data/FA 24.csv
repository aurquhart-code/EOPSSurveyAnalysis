The program provided me with a supportive community and valuable resources that helped me navigate academic challenges and stay on track. Through EOPS, I had access to counseling services that allowed me to create a personalized education plan and set achievable goals. My counselor also connected me with tutors and mentors who helped me better understand complex course material and develop effective study habits. Additionally, the EOPS workshops and events helped me develop essential skills such as time management, note-taking, and test-taking strategies. These skills not only improved my academic performance but also boosted my confidence and reduced stress. Furthermore, the EOPS staff and peers provided a sense of belonging and encouragement, which motivated me to stay focused and committed to my goals. Knowing that I had a support system in place made a huge difference in my ability to overcome obstacles and push through difficult times. Overall, EOPS services helped me succeed this semester by providing a comprehensive support system that addressed my academic, emotional, and social needs. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be part of this program and look forward to continuing to utilize its resources in future semesters.","Although EOPS services did help me succeed this semester, I can reflect on some areas where I think the program could improve if I hadn't had a positive experience.

Here is what if EOPS services hadn't helped me succeed, I think it would be because I didn't feel a strong sense of connection with the program. To improve this, I would suggest that EOPS counselors and staff make a more concerted effort to reach out to students and build relationships. This could be as simple as regular check-ins, personalized emails, or even just knowing students' names and interests.  Another area for improvement could be providing more proactive support. If I hadn't sought out EOPS services on my own, I might not have known about the resources available to me. To address this, EOPS could consider implementing a more proactive outreach program, where counselors or peer mentors reach out to students who may be struggling or who are new to the program.  Additionally, I think EOPS could benefit from more varied and flexible support options. Some students may prefer online resources, while others may prefer in-person support. Offering a range of options, such as online tutoring, virtual counseling sessions, or peer-led study groups, could help ensure that all students have access to the support they need.  Lastly, I believe that EOPS could improve by soliciting more feedback from students who aren't utilizing its services. By understanding the reasons why some students aren't taking advantage of EOPS resources, the program could identify areas for improvement and make targeted changes to better support all students.  By addressing these areas, I believe EOPS can continue to improve its services and benefits to support students who may not be succeeding, and help them achieve their academic goals.","Housing Needs, Food Needs, Transportation Needs, Mental Health/Wellness, Academic Support/Study Skills, Technology, Personal Safety, Employment, Financial Wellness","As a finance major at Southwestern College, I'm excited to dive deeper into my studies and prepare for a career in the financial industry. To help me achieve my goals, I'd love to see more resources and services tailored to finance students.  One area where I'd appreciate more support is in career development and networking opportunities. I'd love to see more finance-specific job fairs, internship opportunities, and guest speaker events that bring industry professionals to campus. This would help me build connections, learn about job opportunities, and gain a better understanding of the finance industry.  Additionally, I'd benefit from more academic support services, such as tutoring and mentoring programs, that cater specifically to finance students. I'd love to have access to experienced finance professionals or peer tutors who can help me navigate complex financial concepts and provide guidance on course selection and career paths.  I'd also appreciate more opportunities for hands-on learning and real-world experience. This could include internships, case competitions, or even a finance club that allows students to manage a mock portfolio or participate in investment simulations. These types of experiences would help me develop practical skills, build my confidence, and make me a more competitive candidate in the job market.  Furthermore, I think it would be incredibly valuable to have more resources and support for finance students who are preparing for professional certifications. This could include study groups, review courses, or even just access to study materials and resources.  As an EOPS student, I believe that the program could play a significant role in supporting my academic and career goals. I'd love to see EOPS offer more services specifically tailored to finance students, such as:  Academic counseling and advising to help me create a personalized education plan and stay on track with my finance coursework,  Access to finance-specific tutoring and mentoring programs to help me succeed in challenging courses,  Assistance with internship and job placement, including resume review, interview preparation, and job search strategies,  Opportunities to connect with finance professionals and alumni through networking events and mentorship programs, Support with applying for scholarships and financial aid to help me fund my education and pursue my finance career goals.  By providing these services and resources, I believe that EOPS and Southwestern College can help me and other finance students achieve our academic and career goals, and set us up for success in the finance industry.",RV

This guidance has been instrumental in helping me navigate course selection, thereby ensuring that I remain on track to meet my educational goals.

Moreover, EOP facilitates access to various academic resources, including tutoring services and workshops that enhance my learning skills. These resources have not only bolstered my understanding of course material but have also fostered a greater sense of confidence in my academic abilities. The program’s emphasis on community and peer support has further enriched my educational journey, allowing me to connect with fellow students who share similar aspirations and challenges. 

Financial assistance provided through EOP has alleviated some of the monetary burdens associated with higher education, enabling me to focus more on my studies rather than worrying excessively about tuition and textbook costs.

Having the mandatory meetings gave me structure to stay in school and continue on the correct path. As well as having a book money, allowing me not to ever worry about books was amazing. Nothing but horror stories I've heard about the cost of them but those books I was able to donate them back to EOPS or even pass them down to classmates. I think it should be emphasized more that you can return the books for more students as donations. I didn't know until late this semester. So, imagine all the other books that could have made their way to EOPS. I never sold them to people because if its free to me, it should be for them too. I think people would do the same.

I used to see a psychiatrist but quit about 2 years ago and she was the one who diagnosed me with Anxiety disorder and gave me the ESA letter then but it has been two years. I need to renew one but that doctor no longer works there. I wanted to check if I am able to see a social worker or therapist possibly through Southwestern College and if they would be able to help me out with another letter as my cat relives my anxiety. (Of course I would need to see the therapist for at least a month before this could be possible) if not maybe the school is able to refer me to a new doctor. That is why I checked housing needs and mental health wellness they go together. Also my cal -fresh benefits were reduced from $292 to $23 a month and I can not survive on $23 a month. I am in the process of filing an appeal because my benefits should have not been reduced this much. I am working but not enough to change my income. They changed it when I did my annual recertification and turned in my financial aid data as well as my usual income. I did not think they could use my financial aid as income against how much cal fresh I recieve that is why I am filing an appeal.  ,JD
