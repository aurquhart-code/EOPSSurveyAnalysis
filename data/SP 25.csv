It would also be helpful if counselors had more availability or flexible scheduling options, like earlier or later hours or virtual appointments, for those of us with tight class or work schedules.

Sometimes the wait times can be long, especially during busy periods, so having a more efficient check-in process or offering more online options could help. Also, making sure all staff members are consistently friendly and approachable goes a long way in creating a welcoming environment. Clearer communication about appointment scheduling, deadlines, and required documents would also make things smoother for students. I appreciate the work the staff does and think these small changes could make a big difference.","Yes, EOPS services definitely helped me succeed this semester. The counseling appointments were incredibly valuable—they helped me stay on track academically and made it easier to plan my schedule and meet important deadlines. The priority registration benefit was also a huge help in securing the classes I needed. On top of that, the book voucher relieved a lot of financial stress and allowed me to focus more on my studies. I really appreciated the consistent support and communication from the EOPS staff—they made me feel seen and supported throughout the semester.","Unfortunately, I didn’t feel the full benefit of EOPS services this semester. I think more regular check-ins or reminders about available resources would be helpful, especially during busy times in the semester. Sometimes I wasn’t sure how to access certain benefits like the book voucher or when to schedule counseling appointments.

Academic advising would be extremely helpful to ensure I’m on track with my major and transfer goals. I’d also benefit from career counseling to explore options related to my field of interest and gain clarity on possible career paths.

Additionally, I don’t have a car, and I need one to get around more efficiently. I also need more financial support in general to help cover basic expenses.
